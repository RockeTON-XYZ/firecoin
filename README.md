# Metrics

The essential step in any machine learning model is to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The list of of available metrics supported by the library is as follow:


* accuracy_score: Number of correct predictions/Total number of predictions
* precision_score:  the proportion of positively predicted labels that are actually correct
* recall_score: the model's ability to correctly predict the positives out of actual positives
* f1_score: 2.Precision.Recall/(Precision+Recall)
* MAE: Mean Absolute Error
* MAPE: Mean Absolute Percentage Error
* MASE: Mean Absolute Scaled Error
* RMSE: Root Mean Square Error
* SMAPE: Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error
* Stochastic: the possibility that the outcome is not that expected, given that both the model and parameters are correct
